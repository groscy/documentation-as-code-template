## Prerequisites

Install https://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/[Ruby] Gems:

* https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoctor/latest/install/[Asciidoctor]
* https://docs.asciidoctor.org/diagram-extension/latest/[Asciidoctor-Diagrams]
* https://docs.asciidoctor.org/pdf-converter/latest/install/[Asciidoctor-PDF]
* https://github.com/Alwinator/asciidoctor-lists[Asciidoctor-Lists]

To install required gems use the `bundle` command

* Download the https://static.structurizr.com/download/structurizr-cli.zip[structurizr-cli], unzip and move it into `./bin/structurizr-cli`
```shell
curl --show-error --location https://static.structurizr.com/download/structurizr-cli.zip | tar -xf - -C bin/structurizr-cli
```

## Build  

* Generate the diagrams from the structurizr workspace model

[source,batch]

*Parameters*
+ 
|===
|Name|Description|Required?
|`:link:`|Used to define the chapter link for xrefs|	
 &#10003;
|`:title:`|The requirement title used additionally for the link text of any xrefs to this requirement | &#10003;
|`:description:`|A short description of the requirement, needs to be in a format that can be included using the `include:...[]` syntax | &#10003;

|`:tableTitle:`|The title of the table|(&#10003;) only needed if `:table:` is defined
|===
. To include the requirement in the document use
[source,asciidoc]
\include::requirements/<newRequirement>.adoc[]
\include::{templates}/requirement.adoc[]

## Create new quality scenario

. Create a new numbered quality scenario under `documentation/src/qualities` 
. Use the following attributes to convey the necessary info about the quality scenario
